## Week 5 Exercises

### Exercise 10
1. Test the code from slide 65 to see how the variable retains its value
2. Amend your code from exercise 9 to store the timer in a variable
3. When keyDown() is pressed clear the last timer
4. Now, when you press a key more than once it should not affect the speed (and pressing a different key will change the direction!)
5. Add another key press, when space is pressed stop the circle from moving by clearing the timer
	_Hint: You should only have one timer variable_
